# The Israel-Palestine Conflict

Hey Hachyderm,

Before we get started, we wanted to acknowledge that it's been a while since have used this forum to communicate. We have established a plan to cover a number of topics over the coming weeks
and months and you should expect to see more activity through the blog starting this month.

Today we wanted to discuss the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine. We there is a significant amount of history understand  the emotions tied to the conversation because it's something that
hits close to home for many of us.

## Where We Stand

Firstly, we want to make it clear that we're heartbroken by the violenc and the loss of innocent lives, and we stand firmly against war. The devastation and suffering caused by this conflict are tragedies,
and we believe in the importance of peace and understanding to resolve disputes.

## Speaking Up, With Respect
We uphold the right of our community members to express their views and critique political structures. However, we feel it's important to remind our community that the guidelines don't allow for blanket
statements or sweeping claims about religions or people of a specific faith. It's important to separate the actions of a government from the beliefs of individuals.

When it comes to the Israel-Palestine situation, we know religion is a big part of society for both sides, but let's not forget that religions aren't defined solely by these governments, even if their
leaders are prominent figures with loud voices. Religions are diverse, with many different interpretations and practices. It's not fair to make generalizations based on the actions of a few and those sorts
of comments won't be tolerated.

As we continue to discuss this topic, letâ€™s strive to promote understanding, empathy, and respect. Remember, behind every post and comment there's a real person that we could learn from and grow with through
respectful and open-minded conversations.

We highly recommend reviewing the Give Your Permission https://community.hachyderm.io/docs/hachyderm/mental-health/#give-yourself-permission section of the documentation for further advice about approaching
these sensitive topics.

Warmly,
Your Hachyderm Moderators
