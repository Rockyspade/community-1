Hachyderm is primarily funded by individual Hachydermians either directly to the Hachyderm project
or to Hachyderm's parent org, the Nivenly Foundation. Although corporate accounts assist with paying
for Hachyderm's infrastructure costs, they are not the primary source of funding for Hachyderm.

## How to donate

One fast, easy way to donate to help finance Hachyderm is directly via Hachyderm's GitHub
Sponsors page:

<a class="btn btn-primary mb-4" href="https://github.com/sponsors/hachyderm">Donate <i class="fa-brands fa-github ml-1"></i></a>

Hachyderm's GitHub sponsors page has a few benefits, including:

* Sponsor icon on your GitHub profile
* (Optional) A shout out on our [#ThankYouThursday](https://hachyderm.io/tags/ThankYouThursday) on Hachyderm's Hachyderm account starting in April.<br />
* (Optional) Added to our Thank You list at the bottom of this page starting in April.

For both the shoutouts and Thank You list: we will use your GitHub username by default.
If you would like this changed please either [submit a PR](https://github.com/hachyderm/community/pulls) or email us at [admin@hachyderm.io](admin@hachyderm.io).

### Donation Options

The three ways to support Hachyderm are:

* Donating directly to the Hachyderm project
* Donating to Hachyderm's parent organization, the Nivenly Foundation
* Purchasing swag

#### Regular Donations

(... and swag)

* [Hachyderm's GitHub Sponsor page](https://github.com/sponsors/hachyderm) <i class="fa-brands fa-github"></i> <br />
  This is the same as the Donate button above.
* [Nivenly's GitHub Sponsor page](https://github.com/sponsors/nivenly) <i class="fa-brands fa-github"></i> <br />
  The Nivenly Foundation is the parent organization for Hachyderm. You can configure
  either one-time or recurring donations.
* [Nivenly's Ko-fi page](https://ko-fi.com/nivenly) <i class="far fa-coffee"></i><br />
  This is an alternative method to donating to The Nivenly
  Foundation, Hachyderm's parent organization. You can configure
  either one-time or recurring donations.
* [Nivenly Donation via Stripe](https://donate.stripe.com/3cs8Apb7R6eK3a83cd) <i class="fa-solid fa-credit-card"></i> <br />
  This is a one-time donation via credit card payment to the Nivenly Foundation.

Please visit our swag store if you're looking to update your awesome assortment
of shirts, mugs, stickers, and so on:

* [The Nivenly Foundation Swag Store](https://nivenly.myspreadshop.com/) <i class="fa-solid fa-shirt"></i> <br />
  Has swag for Nivenly, Hachyderm, and Aurae!

#### The Nivenly Foundation and Membership

[The Nivenly Foundation](https://nivenly.org) is the parent organization for Hachyderm. The non-profit
co-op itself is being founded over the course of 2023. Currently, Nivenly is a recognized non-profit in
the State of Washington, with upcoming milestones to be completed with the IRS. Please check out Nivenly's
[webpage](https://nivenly.org) and [Hachyderm account](https://hachyderm.io/@nivenly) for updates as we
reach different milestones. 

As relevant to Hachyderm: since the Nivenly Foundation funds Hachyderm and other projects, this means
that Nivenly donations and memberships _also_ support Hachyderm. The main difference between the paths
of supporting Hachyderm is that Nivenly members take part in member elections and non-member sponsors
and donors do not. Regular donations do not count as or toward memberships, but you can change your
preference from donor to member at any time.

General Nivenly Membership can be purchased through [Nivenly's new Open Collective page](https://opencollective.com/nivenly-foundation).
If you are looking to join Nivenly as a project or trade member, you must email [info@nivenly.org](mailto:info@nivenly.org).


## Thank you everyone!

Our first set of Thank Yous will be added here in April, one month after our March 2023 release.
Updates afterward will be quarterly in June, September, and December 2023. We will update from our
public GitHub Sponsors primarily, as we are treating private GitHub Sponsors, Ko-fi, and Stripe donations
private. If you have sent us a donation via one of these and do _not_ want it to be private, and _do_ want
to be on this page, please contact us at [admin@hachyderm.io](mailto:admin@hachyderm.io). The amount
each donor donated will _not_ be listed on this page, name/handle only.
