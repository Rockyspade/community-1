#### I'm new to Mastodon in general. Help?

If you're new to Mastodon in general, we recommend taking a look at [Mastodon.Help's brief explainer](https://mastodon.help/)
about what Mastodon is and isn't, as well as taking a look at [fedi.tips](https://fedi.tips/) for some How To Dos.

As for How to be a Hachydermian, take a look at the docs in [our Hachyderm section](/docs/hachyderm/).

#### Can I create a non-user account?

Accounts that are not for an individual person's personal use are referred to as "Specialized Accounts"
and are categorized as corporate, bots, curated, OSS Project, Community Event, and Influencer Accounts.
Some accounts are restricted and/or invite-only and many have rules governing how they can interact with
the platform. Unrecognized account types are suspended. Please read our [Account Types documentation](account-types/)
for more information.

#### I am the mod / admin of another instance and need to contact the Hachyderm mods / admins.

Please email us at [admin@hachyderm.io](mailto:admin@hachyderm.io).

#### I have an issue that requires the moderation team, please help.

If the issue is regarding a user or post, please use the report feature in Mastodon. If you need to
reach the mods another way, please look at our [Reporting and Communication page](moderation/reporting/).

#### I would like to know why a user or instance was moderated. How do I reach out and what can I expect?

Due to our size, we do not publicly share moderation information. That said:

* If you are moderator of a different instance and are contacting us about either your
  instance or a user on your instance, please email us at [admin@hachyderm.io](admin@hachyderm.io).
* If you are the moderated user and you are not on Hachyderm, please email us
  at [admin@hachyderm.io](admin@hachyderm.io).
* If you are the moderated user and you _are_ on Hachyderm, please see our doc for  
  [how to file an Appeal](moderation/actions-and-appeals/).

If you are not the moderated user and not on a moderation team, please still feel free
to email us at [admin@hachyderm.io](admin@hachyderm.io) to confirm if a user or instance
is moderated or not. The main focus of moderation is community safety, so if a specific
user or instance has been temporarily or permanently moderated, then we most common
reason is that we saw an incident or behavioral pattern that we believed posed a risk
to community safety.

#### I have been moderated and would like to know what to do.

Please take a look at our [Moderation Actions and Appeals page](moderation/actions-and-appeals/).

#### I would like to know more about how Hachyderm is moderated, so that I can determine if Hachyderm is a safe space for me.

Please start by looking at both [our Rule Explainer](rule-explainer/) and [our Moderator Covenant](moderation/covenant/).
The main rule of Hachyderm is "Don't Be A Dick" and the remaining rules explicitly call out common
"whataboutisms". The Rule Explainer dives into these different facets to provide additional clarity.
The Moderator Covenant is to show how the rules are enforced and what is used to guide our decisions.

The other rules we have are governing [the account types](account-types/) permitted on Hachyderm and how
often they can post and how they can interact on the platform.

#### Who designed the Hachyderm logo?

Our logo was designed by the lovely Ashton Rainbows. ([website](https://ashtonrainbows.com/), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ashtonrainbows/)) 

Thank you Ashton!
